Dr. Zhenming Su is a Research Biology Specialist II at the Institute for Fisheries Research, Department of Natural Resources and University of Michigan. His research involves in developing and refining angler survey sampling design and methodology, and developing quantities models for recreational fisheries for the inland and Great Lakes waters of Michigan.

His broad research interests include Bayesian statistical modeling and data analysis; fish population dynamics; ecological and fisheries statistical modeling; sampling survey theory and methodology; statistical computing and programming; spatial data analysis; Bayesian dynamic modeling and forecasting; animal and fish abundance estimation.
